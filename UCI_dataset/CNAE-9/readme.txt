Data Set Information:
This is a data set containing 1080 documents of free text business descriptions of Brazilian companies categorized into a 
subset of 9 categories cataloged in a table called National Classification of Economic Activities (ClassificaÃ§Ã£o Nacional de 
Atividade EconÃ´micas - CNAE). The original texts were pre-processed to obtain the current data set: initially, it was kept only 
letters and then it was removed prepositions of the texts. Next, the words were transformed to their canonical form. Finally, 
each document was represented as a vector, where the weight of each word is its frequency in the document. This data set is 
highly sparse (99.22% of the matrix is filled with zeros).
